1. Raspberry Pi 2B
  - It has 1 GB Ram; 40 GPIO pins


Term:
GPIO: General-purpose input/output  
RXD: Receive Data
TXD: Transmit Data
I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit, a multi-master, multi-slave, single-ended, serial computer bus.
  - SCL: clock line
  - SDA: data line
UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It takes bytes of data and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion
  - 
SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface Bus. A synchronous serial communication interface. Typical applications include Secure Digital cards and liquid crystal display Serial Peripheral Interface Bus. A synchronous serial communication interface. Typical applications include Secure Digital cards and liquid crystal displays. It specifies 4 logic signals:
  - SCLK: serial clock (output from master)
  - MOSI: Master Output, Slave Input
  - MISO: Master Input, Slave Output
  - SS: Slave Select
