MacVim
1. Install: 
brew install macvim
brew link macvim

2. Install pathogen.vim to make install plugins and runtime files easier
Follow the instructions: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
Initially you don't have the ~/.vimrc file and you will need to create one.

3. Install MERD Tree for MacVim
Tried to install it without pathogen while it shows a bunch of errors while start the vim:
	mkdir ~/.vim/plugin
	git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
The correct way after installed pathogen:
	go to ~/.vim/bundle
	git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
	Restart vim
	(Instructions from: https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
4. Install Vundle following: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
5. Install UltiSnips following: https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips after installed Vundle

Notice, you should make sure the system are using macvim instead of the original one
Basically you will need to add:
alias vi='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim'
alias vim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim'
alias gvi='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g'
to your ~/.bash_profile
